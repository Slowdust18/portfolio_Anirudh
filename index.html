                <p>
                    I am a sophomore at SRM Institute of science and Technology. With a strong foundation in programming languages such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, and CSS, I have developed a keen interest in leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. My expertise extends to various Python libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn, which I utilize to analyze data and build predictive models. I am passionate about exploring the potential of AI and machine learning to drive innovation and improve lives. Through my projects and internships, I have gained valuable experience in data analysis, model development, and deployment. I am excited to continue learning and contributing to the tech community with my skills and creativity.I like listening to music play games and read books
